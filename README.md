# Sudoku Solver #

This is an app I built while learning how to code at [The Last Mile](https://thelastmile.org/) in 2020. It solves a number of preset sudoku puzzles, but it will also allow you to enter your own puzzle and solve it too, so long as it is a valid puzzle.
  
To run the app, simply open the `index.html` page in a browser, select a puzzle (or enter your own values), and click SOLVE.
